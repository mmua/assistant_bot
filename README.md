## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmua/assistant_bot.git
cd assistant_bot
```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SBER_SPEECH_API_KEY=your_sber_speech_api_key
YANDEX_API_KEY=your_yandex_api_key
YANDEX_FOLDER_ID=your_yandex_folder_id
ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID=your_telegram_id
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Database Setup**:
```bash
python -m bot.database.init_db
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands
- `/start` - Begin a new conversation session
- `/next` - Start a new session while preserving history
- `/forget` - Clear all history and start fresh
- `/add_user <user_id>` - (Admin only) Add new authorized users

### Voice Messages
The bot accepts voice messages and provides winter-themed responses during processing:
1. Send a voice message
2. Wait for transcription
3. Review the transcribed text
4. Get the bot's response

The bot supports both direct messages and forwarded voice messages, maintaining attribution for forwarded content.

### Image Processing
Send any image to the bot with an optional caption to process it. The bot automatically determines the best processing method based on the caption:

1. **Text Extraction**: 
   - Send an image containing text
   - Supports multiple languages
   - Preserves text layout and structure
   - Ideal for documents, screenshots, and presentations

2. **Diagram Conversion**: 
   - Send a diagram with caption like "convert to plantuml"
   - Supports various diagram types (flowcharts, UML, etc.)
   - Generates editable PlantUML code
   - Maintains diagram relationships and structure

3. **Presentation Analysis**: 
   - Send a presentation slide for content analysis
   - Extracts key points and structure
   - Provides summaries and insights
   - Identifies main themes and topics

4. **General Analysis**: 
   - Send any image for content description
   - Detailed scene understanding
   - Object identification
   - Context interpretation

The bot understands natural language captions and chooses the appropriate processing method automatically.

### Session Management
- Each conversation is managed in sessions
- Long conversations are automatically summarized
- Previous context is intelligently retrieved when relevant
- Use /next to start a new session while keeping history
- Use /forget to completely reset the conversation
